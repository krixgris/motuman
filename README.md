Opening up this for public contribution and consumption.

Contributions are welcome, but I have not yet taken the time to write up what needs improvements and work other than what is in the issues.

Documentation is highly needed, so any contributions would be more than welcome, as long as they follow rust standard conventions for documenting.

This readme is also in dire need of help.
